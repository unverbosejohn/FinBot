# Contributing to FinBot

Thank you for your interest in contributing to FinBot! We appreciate your involvement and look forward to collaborating with you. Below are some guidelines to help you get started with making contributions.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository**: Fork the FinBot repository to your GitHub account. This will create a copy of the repository in your account that you can make changes to.

2. **Clone Your Fork**: Clone your fork to your local machine using the following command, replacing `your-username` with your GitHub username:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/FinBot.git

3. **Set Up Upstream**: Add the original repository as an upstream remote to keep your fork updated with the latest changes:
git remote add upstream https://github.com/unverbosejohn/FinBot.git

## Making Changes
Create a Branch: Create a new branch for the changes you want to make. Name your branch something descriptive to the changes you are proposing.
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
Make Your Changes: Make your changes and commit them to your branch. Keep your commits clean and descriptive of the changes you made.

git add .
git commit -m "Describe your changes here"
Pull the Latest Changes: Before pushing your changes, pull the latest changes from the upstream repository to avoid merge conflicts:

git pull upstream main

Push Your Changes: Push your changes to your fork on GitHub:
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

## Submitting a Pull Request
Open a Pull Request: Go to the FinBot repository on GitHub, and click on the "New Pull Request" button. Choose the branch from your fork that contains your changes, and submit a pull request against the main branch of the FinBot repository.

Describe Your Changes: In the pull request, describe the changes you made and any issues you believe your changes resolve.

Wait for Review: Wait for maintainers to review your pull request. They may suggest changes or improvements. Make any necessary updates and push them to your branch.

Get Merged: Once your pull request has been reviewed and approved, a maintainer will merge it into the main branch. Congratulations, and thank you for your contribution!
